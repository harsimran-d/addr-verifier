# Address Verifier

In this project I intend to learn to implement ownership verification using wallet adapters to wether a person owns control of a particualr public key.

In future i would add more code to access verfications across different wallets and blockchains and also support multiple public keys in the future.

As is this project might not have a production worthy use case
but it could be a greate microservice for some of the other big projects i am building.
